        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h4>iNTRODUCTION</h4>
        My name is Aturu Oluwatomiwa Miracle. A 2023 graduate of high school. 
        My student ID is ALT/SOE/024/0872.
        I currently school at the university of lagos where i study electrical and electronics engineering, also in my 3rd year.
        when i am not studying for exams or coding, i enjoy reading books, swimming, watching TV
        I have an interest in the cloud and how it solves the problem of agility and flexibility.
    
        <h4>REASONS WHY I JOINED ALT SCHOOL</h4>
        I have always taken an interest to building things, but it took a while before i 
        realized which and what kind of things i wanted to build. it was not untill 2023 when 
        i took interest in the cloud but unfortunately i sought for a structured process that would 
        put me through but did not find one. Eventually i found ALTSchool, after going through their
        curriculum, i found that it was in alignment with what i wanted from a structured learning process
        I want to live a life that is full of healthy responsibilties. additionally, i want to 
        be a solution the world around me
        <h4>MY GOALS</h4>
        gaining proficiency in my tech track would be my immediate goal
        Ultimately, I want to get a job in tech and be a source of hope and encouragement to those around me
